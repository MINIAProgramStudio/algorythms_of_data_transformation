7ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
c
Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there.?
 2 Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
 
 Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
 $ Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
 + Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bit
ter cold,
 Å And I am sick at heart.
   Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, go
od night.
 Å If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
 Å ,The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

 ë Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  

 5 Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
   Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you go
od night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
 Å Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
 Å 
Give you go	od night. † Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
 Å What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
 " Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
 ) Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
 Å And wil"l not let belief take hold of him
 Å $Touching this dreaded sight, twice se
en of us.
 Å %Therefore I have entreated him along,  
 Å ,With us to watch the minutes of this night,
 Å That, if again this apparition come,
 Å He may ap prove our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
 Å And let us once again assail your ears,
 Å )That are so fortified against our story,
 Å What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
 Å (And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
 Å 2When yond same star that's westward from the pole
 Å Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
 Å Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
 Å The bell then beating one-

 ï Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
 4 Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
 0 Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Lo,oks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
 5 Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
 Å )Together with that fair and warlike form
 Å 'In which the majesty of buried Denmark
 Å *Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge the	e speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
 % Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge the	e speak!
 ≤ Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
 ) Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and lo	ok pale.
 Å )Is not this something more than fantasy?
 Å What think you on't?
 . Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
 Å %Without the sensible and true avouch
 Å Of mine own eyes.  
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
 Å #Such was the very armour he had on
 Å 'When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
 Å ,So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
 Å He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
 Å 'Tis strange.
 5 Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
 Å .With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
 5 Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
 Å But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
 Å /This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
 Å .Why this same strict and most observant watch
 Å *So nightly toils the subject of the land,
 Å $And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
 Å (And foreign mart for implements of war;
 Å Why such impres"s of shipwrights, whose sore task
 Å %Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
 Å ,What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
 Å 1Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
 Å Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
 Å .At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
 Å Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
 Å +Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
 Å ,Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
 Å 1Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
 Å ((For so this side of our known world este
em'd him)
 Å 4Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
 Å Wel l ratified by law and heraldry,
 Å Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
 Å Which he sto od seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
 Å %Against the which a moiety competent
 Å *Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
 Å "To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
 Å Had he be&en vanquisher, as, by the same comart
 Å And carriage of the article design'd,
 Å His fel)l to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
 Å Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
 Å .Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
 Å Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
 Å For fo od and diet, to some enterprise
 Å -That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
 Å As it doth well appear unto our state,
 Å %But to recover of us, by strong hand
 Å -And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
 Å ,So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
 Å (Is the main motive of our preparations,
 Å 1The source of this our watch, and the chief head
 Å +Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
 * Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
 Å Wel*l may it sort that this portentous figure
 Å 0Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
 Å ,That was and is the question of these wars.
 . Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
 Å *In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
 Å A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
 Å The graves stood tenantless, and the she
eted dead
 Å Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
 Å ,As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
 Å )Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
 Å -Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
 Å Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
 Å -And even the like precurse of fierce events,
 Å As harbingers preceding still the fates
 Å $And prologue to the omen coming on,
 Å ,Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
 Å "Unto our climature and countrymen.

 ì Enter Ghost again.

 Å ,But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
 Å I'll cros!s it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
 ¨ Spreads his arms.
 Å )If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
 Å Speak to me.
 Å If there be any good thing to be done,
 Å That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
 Å Speak to me.  
 Å )If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
 Å Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
 Å 
O, speak!
 Å &Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
 Å 'Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
 Å 6(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
 Æ The cock crows.
 Å -Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
 	 Mar. Shal#l I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
 ≤ Exit Ghost.
 Å %We do it wrong, being so majestical,
 Å To offer it the show of violence;
 Å $For it is as the air, invulnerable,
 Å &And our vain blows malicious mockery.
 1 Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
 . Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
 Å Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
 Å +The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
 Å Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
 Å *Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
 Å )Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
 Å Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
 Å (To his confine; and of the truth herein
 Å $This present object made probation.
 + Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
 Å .Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
 Å +Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
 Å The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
 Å 0And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
 Å 2The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
 Å /No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
 Å So hal#low'd and so gracious is the time.
 1 Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
 Å But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
 Å *Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
 Å 'Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
 Å Let us impart what we have seen to-night
 Å &Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
 Å This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
 Å Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
 Å As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
 Å ,Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
 Å Where we shall find him most conveniently. à Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
<
Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the QueUen, Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

 5 King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
 Å The memory be green, and that it us befitted
 Å 3To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
 Å %To be contracted in one brow of woe,
 Å .Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
 Å That we with wisest sorrow think on him
 Å (Together with remembrance of ourselves.
 Å )Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
 Å Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
 Å (Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
 Å With an auspicious, and a drop
ping eye,
 Å +With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
 Å *In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
 Å $Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
 Å Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
 Å With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
 Å Now fol'lows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
 Å Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
 Å -Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
 Å +Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
 Å Col*leagued with this dream of his advantage,
 Å 'He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
 Å Importing the surrender of those lands
 Å Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
 Å .To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
 Å &Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
 Å Thus much the business is: we have here writ
 Å &To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
 Å )Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
 Å #Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
 Å -His further gait herein, in that the levies,
 Å The lists, and full proportions are all made
 Å )Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
 Å You, go"od Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
 Å For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
 Å (Giving to you no further personal power
 Å 	To busines%s with the King, more than the scope
 Å Of these dilated articles allow. â [Gives a paper.]
 Å Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
 + King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
 û  Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
 Å ,And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
 Å .You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
 Å You can not speak of reason to the Dane
 Å 5And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
 Å That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
 Å *The head is not more native to the heart,
 Å )The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
 Å -Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
 Å !What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
 Å +Your leave and favour to return to France;
 Å From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
 Å #To show my duty in your coronation,  
 Å Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
 Å 0My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
 Å 0And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
 9 King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
 4 Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
 Å $By laboursome petition, and at last
 Å Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
 Å I do beseech you give him leave to go.
 3 King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
 Å &And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
 Å 'But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
 $ King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Go$od Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
 Å And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
 Å %Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
 Å Se%ek for thy noble father in the dust.
 Å Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
 Å Pas sing through nature to eternity.  
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
 Å Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Se%ems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
 Å 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
 Å %Nor customary suits of solemn black,
 Å (Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
 Å 'No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
 Å 'Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
 Å Together with al
l forms, moods, shapes of grief,
 Å $'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
 Å ,For they are actions that a man might play;
 Å But I have that within which passeth show-
 Å These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis swe	et and com!mendable in your nature, Hamlet,
 Å .To give these mourning duties to your father;
 Å .But you must know, your father lost a father;
 Å 3That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
 Å #In filial obligation for some term
 Å To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
 Å %In obstinate condolement is a course
 Å Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
 Å It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
 Å 'A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
 Å !An understanding simple and unschool'd;
 Å &For what we know must be, and is as common
 Å 'As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
 Å Why should we in our peevish op	position
 Å /Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
 Å -A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
 Å To reason most absurd, whose com
mon theme
 Å  Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
 Å From the first corse till he that died to-day,
 Å .'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
 Å 'This unprevailing woe, and think of us
 Å ,As of a father; for let the world take note
 Å You are the most immediate to our throne,
 Å And with no less nobility of love
 Å -Than that which dearest father bears his son
 Å 'Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
 Å In going back to school in Wit	tenberg,
 Å %It is most retrograde to our desire;
 Å 
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
 Å Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
 Å ,Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Que1en. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
 Å 	I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wit	tenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
 , King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
 Å 'Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
 Å This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
 Å ,Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
 Å ,No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
 Å But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
 Å #And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
 Å 'Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
 ù Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
 Å %Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
 Å %Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
 Å .His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
 Å )How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
 Å Se
em to me all the uses of this world!
 Å Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
 Å That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
 Å Posses*s it merely. That it should come to this!
 Å 0But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
 Å So excellent a king, that was to this
 Å ,Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
 Å That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
 Å Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
 Å ,Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
 Å As if increase of appetite had grown
 Å ,By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
 Å 4Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
 Å A lit'tle month, or ere those shoes were old
 Å With which she fol
lowed my poor father's body
 Å Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
 Å /(O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
 Å Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
 Å 0My father's brother, but no more like my father
 Å $Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
 Å +Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
 Å Had left the flushing in her gal
led eyes,
 Å She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
 Å $With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
 Å It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
 Å .But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

 á Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
 Å !Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
 # Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
 Å And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
 Å Marcellus?
 
 Mar. My go	od lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
 Å $But what, in faith, make you from Wit	tenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
 * Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
 Å Nor shall you do my ear that violence
 Å &To make it truster of your own report
 Å ,Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
 Å But what is your affair in Elsinore?
 Å We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
 Å I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
 	 Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
 7 Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
 Å Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
 Å )Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
 Å Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
 Å My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
 ! Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
   Hor. I saw him once. He was a go
odly king.  
 " Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
 Å I shall not look upon his like again.
 . Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
 % Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
 ) Hor. Season your admiration for a while
 Å 	With an attent ear, till I may deliver
 Å Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
 Å This marvel to you.
 " Ham. For God's love let me hear!
 . Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
 Å (Marcel!lus and Bernardo) on their watch
 Å In the dead vast and middle of the night
 Å Be0en thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
 Å "Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
 Å Ap(pears before them and with solemn march
 Å 0Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
 Å 
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
 Å 0Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
 Å Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
 Å ,Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
 Å %In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
 Å 0And I with them the third night kept the watch;
 Å ,Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
 Å ,Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
 Å The ap$parition comes. I knew your father.
 Å These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
 3 Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
 Å ,But answer made it none. Yet once methought
 Å It lifted up it head and did address
 Å *Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
 Å *But even then the morning cock crew loud,
 Å )And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
 Å And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
 0 Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
 Å *And we did think it writ down in our duty
 Å To let you know of it.
 	 Ham. Indeed, inde ed, sirs. But this troubles me.
 Å Hold you the watch to-night?
 & Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
 ! Ham. Then saw you not his face?
 . Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
 # Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had be
en there.
 % Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
 + Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
 , Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was griz
zled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
 Å A sable silver'd.
 
 Ham. I will watch to-night.
 Å Perchance 'twill walk again.
 
 Hor. I war
r'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
 Å I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
 Å &And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
 Å +If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
 Å %Let it be tenable in your silence still;
 Å And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
 Å (Give it an understanding but no tongue.
 Å I wil%l requite your loves. So, fare you well.
 Å -Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,

 Å My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
 Å 3I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!

 Å (For he himself is subject to his birth.
 Å $He may not, as unvalued persons do,
 Å -Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
 Å +The safety and health of this whole state,
 Å /And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
 Å )Unto the voice and yielding of that body
 Å 6Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
 Å )It fits your wisdom so far to believe it

 Å air, lo:ok you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical

  Ros. No indeed are they not.  
 ( Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour ke&eps in the wonted pace; but there is,
 Å sir, an eyrie of children, lit$tle eyases, that cry out on the top
 Å of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
 Å the fashion, and so berat
tle the common stages (so they call
 Å /them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and

 Å sing? Wil/l they not say afterwards, if they should grow
 Å themselves to com0mon players (as it is most like, if their means

 Å against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has be,en much to do on both sides; and the nation

  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
 # Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
 @ Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
 Å :history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,

  Ham. I heard thee speak me a spe"ech once, but it was never acted;
 Å ?or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
 Å 
not the mil5lion, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
 Å 3receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
 Å the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
 Å #set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
 Å there were no sal lets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
 Å 	nor no mat2ter in the phrase that might indict the author of
 Å affectation; but cal)l'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
 Å swe4et, and by very much more handsome than fine. One spe	ech in't
 Å BI chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
 Å especial7ly where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in

  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
 Å the point: if I drown myself wit!tingly, it argues an act; and an
 Å act hath thre0e branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
 Å argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
 - Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
 Å man; go:od. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
 Å will he nil7l he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
 Å @him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
 Å 2guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
 
 Other. Wil+l you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a

 B Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk
 Å Bshould have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves
 Å ;more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no
 Å Bancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They

  Other. Was he a gentleman?

 E Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?

 C Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the

 Å full of most excellent dif#ferences, of very soft society and
 Å great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card

  Ham. Sir, his definement suf#fers no perdition in you; though, I 

 Å BBut, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great

 E Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
 Å by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
 ' Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.

 B Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent

 2 Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between

  Osr. I mean, my lord, the op"position of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,

 Å brought, the gentleman wil%ling, and the King hold his purpose,
 Å I wil$l win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my

  Ham. To this ef-fect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
 
 Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.

 C Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
 Å 2and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
 Å Bon, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-
 Å a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and

 ô Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty com&mended him to you by young Osric, who
 Å brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
 Å ?know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
 Å take longer time.
 + Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
 Å If his fitnes5s speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
 Å I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In hap	py time.

 Å Laertes before you fal
l to play.  
  Ham. She well instructs me.
 ± [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
 ; Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
 Å continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
 Å think how ill al(l's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but fo.olery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
 Å would perhaps trouble a woman.
 2 Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I wil	l forestall their
 Å 'repair hither and say you are not fit.
 B Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
 Å the fal

 Å not to come, it wil%l be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:

 7 Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
 Å &But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
 Å This presence knows,

 Å (With sore distraction. What I have done

 Å .And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
 Å +Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
 Å Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,

 8 King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
